# Python_2040
I took this course of Introduction to Python in September 2018. However, this is not my majory require course but I still decided to take it as a challenge together with all my other major courses at the same time. This is because of preparing for self-learning subject in statistics, machine&deep learning in my coming year before graduate. The following .py files are exercises that done within 2 months.
